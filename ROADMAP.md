  - [x] Add volume to json (project file) configuration
  - [x] Handle volume in json import / export
  - [x] Handle volume in midi import/export
  - [x] Handle volume in wav export
- Panning:
  - [x] Add pan to json (project file) configuration
  - [x] Handle panning in json import / export
  - [x] Handle panning in sf2 engine
  - [x] Handle panning in midi import/export
  - [x] Handle panning in wav export
- Velocity:
  - [x] Add velocity to json (project file) notes
  - [x] Support velocity in loadAndPlayNote for sf2
  - [x] Support velocity in loadAndPlayNote for webaudiofont
  - [x] Add UI Elements for adjusting velocity
  - [x] Verify velocity works for:
    - [x] Midi export
    - [x] Midi import
    - [x] Wav export
    - [x] Project file import/export
- Selection:
  - [x] Be able to resize groups of notes
  - [x] Be able to hold CTRL and then left click on notes to select them (multiple unconnected)
  - [x] Remove select mode entirely, and put velocity mode within it
  - [x] Holding down V should show note velocities regardless of the note render mode

## AI Autocomplete
- Critical Bug:
  - [x] Saving user config causes song measures to revert to DEFAULT_GRID_CONFIG.totalMeasures
- Necessary Now
  - [ ] Allow transport seek to be called from the sequencer header row
- Autocomplete
  - [x] Implement Autocomplete Preview
  - [x] Fix Undo/Redo on Autocompletion
  - [ ] Autocomplete preview occurs automatically when enabled (Do we even want this?)
  - [x] Reject button causes a regeneration
  - [x] Add guard so autocomplete cannot occur past song end
  - [x] Add animation to autocomplete preview notes
  - [ ] Add settings popup for adjusting autocomplete context length and other settings
    - [ ] Add setting for full song context (experimental)
    - [ ] Add reduction of other tracks to roman numerals (experimental)
    - [ ] Default to single track context 
    - [ ] Add setting beat suggestion (autocomplete length)
    - [ ] Add setting Force Diatonic (experimental) (postprocess output to be diatonic to the key)
    - [ ] Add setting to transpose all inputs to C Major or A minor, and then transpose output back (experimental) 
  - [ ] Handle drums (Pitch 38 e.g.), will need to vary the prompt generation for drums
  - [x] Divise more robust way of setting active sequencer, e.g. just mousing into a sequencer
  - [x] Autocomplete to determine endbeat right now is just using the last note in the sequencer, instead we should auto complete in gaps if possible,
    - [x] This is tricky because do we go by where the cursor preview is.. Where the last note placed was.. etc.. with fallback to the last note of the song?
  - [ ] Resolve bug where re-generation doesn't trigger a redraw (Existing preview not vanishing)
  - [ ] Resolve bug where if generation fails, the blinking measure animation continues to run
  - [ ] Schedule notes to play that are in the preview so that user can Demo them

- Inpaint/Extend
  - [x] Grey these out for now (lock)

- AI Overlays / Plugins
  - [ ] Add chord commander plugin that:
    - [ ] Prompts AI with existing context (or no context if starting from scratch)
    - [ ] Generates roman numerals
    - [ ] Use tonaljs to convert roman numerals to voiceled chords
  - [ ] AI Texturizer
    - [ ] Feeds measure by measure of chords into AI.  Chords are arpeggiated or given texture.
  - [ ] AI Melody Writer
    - [ ] Feeds measure by measure of chords into AI.  AI generates a melody that fits over the chords.
  - [ ] AI Bassline Writer
    - [ ] Feeds measure by measure of chords into AI.  AI generates a bassline that fits over the chords.
  - [ ] AI Drummer
    - [ ] Feeds measure by measure of chords into AI.  AI generates drums that fit over the chords.

- QOL:
  - [x] Smarter snap durations, auto shift down to the note value you're on
  - [x] Add alternate note placement mode option in the user config (on mouse down note placement into sizing)
  - [x] Hold down alt or something to see all the hotkeys on all UI elements.
- Sequencer Grid:
  - [x] Re-implement sequencer grid drawing entirely.
    - [x] Replace the existing sequencer element with one based from the example in: gridtest.html
    - [x] Thoroughly test after integration
    - [x] Style pass, to make sure it looks as good as the original or better
- JSX Refactor
  - [x] Create all UI components via JSX
  - [x] Refactor UI/handler classes into a clean architecture, separated from business code
  - [x] Use /setup only as orchestration layer

## Bugs
- Critical Bugs:
  - [ ] Velocity not being honored on webaudiofont drums
  - [ ] Express Note tool ocassionally locks up.  Don't know how to reproduce yet.
  - [ ] Can't hover/select/drag an existing chromatic note (when in note locking mode) without holding control
  - [x] Existing HTML defined modals are no longer visible, just replace them with controller based.
  - [x] Volume / Pan not updating properly on load session, and in wrong place when creating sequencer
  - [x] Instrument select menu pops up immediately on app load (needs to be in a controller)
    - [x] Load instrument button listener is not attached to sequencers from load session
  - [x] Changing skin during playback causes major issues, playback stops, all sequencers are expanded.
    - [x] First sequencer's event listeners are detached
    - [x] All sequencers are expanded
    - [x] Playback engine might not be getting the new sequencers, e.g. we need to resync with that
  - [x] Dragging down on a note, and running off of the note can lock handler mode in a weird state where a note has to be placed to do anything.  Drag threshold should be more forgiving moving down.
  - [x] When pressing play after a fresh stop, always starts from the beginning - ignores if user manually moved playhead to a spot
  - [x] webaudiofont instrument wav export is silent. OfflineAudioContext issue. (related to currentTime?)
- Small Bugs:
  - [x] Drum tracks on Wav export throw: Sample not found: '50', Sample not found: '53', etc
  - [x] Double check that we aren't loading instruments/updating state when every note is played. The playhead looks a bit stuttery on playback
  - [x] If loading midi files back to back, will crash on second load
  - [x] If paused, note placement does not preview sound
  - [x] When pasting a cluster of notes, it's possible for some of those notes to be pasted out of bounds (into the piano roll label on the left)
  - [x] If previewing a note (note placement mode) while playblack is ocurring, significant slowdown ensues

## Future Todos
- Side Grip to Collapsed sequencers
  - [ ] Collapsed sequencers should have a side grip which allows you to drag them to a different order.
    - Should probably collapse all sequencers when this grip is active, to facilitate.
- Export Enhancement
  - [ ] The save menu should allow you to choose filename for Wav or Midi export
- Drag to Drop
  - [x] In export menu, add an option to Drag to Drop, wherein the user can drag their midi file into another DAW
- Wav Editing
  - [ ] Add wav tracks
  - [ ] Add recording to a wav track
  - [ ] Add importing existing wav file to a wave track
- Playback Enhancements:
  - [ ] Add loop start/loop end to global playhead
  - [ ] Add playhead follow mode to sequencer topbar (follows playhead, or scrolls when playhead reaches end of screen)
- Note Editing:
  - [ ] Add Quantize Modal for Quantizing groups of selected notes
  - [ ] Add Recording for keyboard
    - [ ] Support live quantization
  - [ ] Add "humanize" to the velocity modal that looks at beats/measure/timesignature to articulate velocity on strong vs weak beats
- [ ] Handle dragging midi files into the app to load them
- [ ] Handle dragging midi files into a sequencer to load it into the sequencer, will prompt with modal if more than one track in the midi file to automatically create sequencers for each track
